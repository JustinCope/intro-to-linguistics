# intro-to-linguistics

Demos illustrating concepts for my Introduction to Linguistics course.

##mu.py##
An algorithm for generating theorems of the MIU-system described by Douglas Hofstadter in *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*.  Useful for discussion of formal languages, string rewriting systems, algorithms, and decideability.  

##temporal-reference-engine.py##
A random temporal expression generator.  

##toy-morphophonology.py##
A toy grammar illustrating the concepts of lexical items as sound-meaning pairs and morphemes as functions.  Particular lexical items evoke discussion of context-dependent phonological changes in morphemes ('house', 'start') or of suppletion ('meet').

Phonological forms are given in broad IPA transcription.  Logical forms are just represented with glosses (e.g. '-PST' for the logical form contributed by past tense morphology) -- at the point in the semester when I introduce this demo, students have no background in formal semantics.
